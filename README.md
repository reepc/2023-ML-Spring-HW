Here's the HW in NTU 2023 Machine Learning Course by Prof. Hung-yi Lee, doing by a senior high school student, so the predictions of test data which are produced by the models here may not be good. But all passed medium baseline.

Here's the course's link https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/ml/2023-spring.php, you can find data and sample code here.
Notice all the models' code here are from sample code.

If you use codes here not, please write the reference.
